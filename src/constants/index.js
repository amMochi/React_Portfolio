high-school career in midst of my healthcare pursuiance, tumbling straight into JavaScript web development, ultimately leading to
 my rabbit hole of programming. Nowadays, I am focused primarily on CTF's and furthering my passion in

I find the most satisfaction in developing software at the
intersection of cybersecurity and programming. <br><br>

During my free time, I enjoy soccer, playing the piano, rock climbing, or finding the next place where I can eat all you-can-eat Korean BBQ.
