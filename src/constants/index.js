I have skills in front-end technologies like React and Tailwind CSS, as well as back-end technologies like Node.js, Python, and AWS. My goal is to leverage my expertise to create innovative solutions that drive business growth and deliver exceptional user experiences.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I decided to try programming mid-way through my 
high-school career in midst of my healthcare pursuiance, tumbling straight into JavaScript web development, ultimately leading to
 my rabbit hole of programming. Nowadays, I am focused primarily on CTF's and furthering my passion in 
cloud and web development.<br><br>

I find the most satisfaction in developing software at the
intersection of cybersecurity and programming -- cars 
that are highly secured with a well built engine.<br><br>

During my free time, I enjoy soccer, playing the piano, rock climbing, or finding the next place where I can eat all you-can-eat korean bbq.
